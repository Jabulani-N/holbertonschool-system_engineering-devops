when you go back to the first question, if there is no specific reply as to using the variable, just make it ((vaiable++)). it won't even need to double the variable used because hte for loop itself will reset it back to the next value in the number list

if an if statement is in a wihle loop, it will trigger before the while loop does. if you want something to happen after teh while loop does, make it trigger on the subsequent iteratin of while.
